#What's this all about?

We interview ecologists, evolutionary biologists (and related folks) and find out what tools they use to make their science rock. We love to hear not just about your software and computing equipment but also about other stuff you use in the field or lab that really helps with your science.

#Can I suggest someone I admire?

Sure! Just drop us an [email](mailto:interviews@eebtools.org).

#Can I suggest myself?

Of course. In fact just fill out this [template](link to gist) and send it back to us. If you are git savvy, then feel free to send us a pull request to this repo.

#How did this idea come about?

We love [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/about/) and modeled the site after it for our community.
