#What's this all about?

We interview other ecologists, evolutionary biologists (and related folks) and find out what tools they use to make their science rock.

#Can I suggest someone I admire?

Sure! Just drop us an [email](mailto:submit@ecotools.org).

#Can I suggest myself?

Of course. In fact just fill out this [template](link to gist) and send it back to us. If you are git savvy, then feel free to send us a pull request to this repo.

#How did this idea come about?

We love [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/about/) and modeled the site after it for our community.
