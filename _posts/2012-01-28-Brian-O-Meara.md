#Who are you and what do you do?

[I](http://brianomeara.info/)'m an assistant professor at the [U. of Tennessee, Knoxville](http://www.utk.edu/) , in the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department](http://eeb.bio.utk.edu/). I answer compelling questions about evolution by developing and applying phylogenetic tools. These often focus on trait evolution, but also tree inference and phylogeography. 

#What hardware do you use?

At work, a 4 year old Mac Pro, upgraded with a SSD. I currently use dual monitors on a standing desk (modified the official work desk by building new, longer legs). At home and on the road, a 15" non-Retina MacBook Pro with traditional and SSD drives. Shared 14' long sitting-height desk at home (wife's side, my side, kids' peninsula in between, all covered in whiteboard paint, which is handy when scientific visitors need to scribble). For teaching, green laser pointer/slide advancer, plus a [Wii whiteboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s5EvhHy7eQ) setup (Wii remote, infrared LED on a stick). For TimeMachine backup, I rotate a few 3 TB Western Digital hard drives so I always have some off site and powered down. A wireless headset for teleconferences is important, too.

#What software do you use?

I use Apple's Mac OS in general (we even have a within-lab [HTCondor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) cluster of ~150 cores based on Mac Pros), though I spend far more time in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) than Finder. I do a lot of work in [R](http://www.r-project.org/). I now use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) rather than the regular R GUI, but also code R using [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) or [vi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). I also use the many [phylogenetics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html) and other [packages in R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/). I typically make figures entirely in R; if not, I may add annotations using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) or [Apple Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/). I use Keynote for preparing talks and lectures: I can work much faster in it and get prettier results than with PowerPoint, plus Keynote stores all the files you need in the main file (no missing movies, unlike PowerPoint). I'm still in the MS Word + Endnote paradigm for writing papers, as most of my collaborators work that way. I am also impressed by Endnote's ability to download full text based on just citations. Sadly, there's still a lot of closed source software in the list above. 

As a grad student I started doing version control with [CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), then switched to [subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/). I have a large repository of most of my work (teaching lectures, manuscripts, code, etc.): 82,724 commits, 212 GB as a gzipped backup. I can check out just particular directories to work on, one of the few advantages of subversion over git. However, if I were starting all over again, I'd go with [git](http://git-scm.com/). I use mostly [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/) for making new packages, but I am increasingly using git with [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/). For backup, I use TimeMachine, as mentioned above, but also [CrashPlan+](http://www.crashplan.com/) (both to their storage and to other machines I control) and rsyncing of database dumps and similar files to other machines. I probably go a bit overboard on backup, but it has been helpful. 

Miscellaneous software: For task management, I've ended up using the [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) system, and I've gone through various web services and software which implement this. I'm currently using [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/). For building websites/web apps to support research, I bounce around between [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) (for my [main website](http://brianomeara.info/)), [PHP](http://us.php.net/) + [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) (for [Lampyr](http://lampyr.org/), [CichlidPhen](http://www.cichlidphen.org/)), and, recently, [FastRWeb](http://www.rforge.net/FastRWeb/) + [RServe](http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/) + [PHP](http://us.php.net/) (for [DateLife](http://datelife.org/)). Within the lab we tend to use Google chat for quick text discussions, as it's always available from the GMail window unlike IRC or Skype. 

#What would your dream set up be?

I recently placed an order for a 27" iMac with 3 TB [Fusion Drive](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6679/a-month-with-apples-fusion-drive) -- it'll feel odd not to use a Mac Pro as a primary machine, but it's been years since the line had a real refresh, and iMacs are faster for most tasks. I might build a standing desk at home, too (I find I work faster when standing, which is my motivation for using it, but it is supposed to have [health benefits](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/business/stand-up-desks-gaining-favor-in-the-workplace.html), too).  Overall, though, I'm very happy with my current setup.
