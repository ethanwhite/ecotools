#Who are you and what do you do?
I'm a postdoc in population biology at Berkeley (ESPM). I work on stage structured dynamics of spider mites but am also involved in various [other projects](http://nature.berkeley.edu/~kram/projects/). I also spend a good bit of time working with [R](http://www.r-project.org/) for my own research and also developing tools for [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org) and various [DataONE](http://dataone.org) projects.

#What hardware do you use?

I've used my trusty MacBook Pro (2009 version) for a few years now. I love it to pieces and will likely upgrade to the retina version once I can afford it (not anytime soon). Macs seem like the best of both worlds for me, great hardware and interface with the full power of UNIX.

I'm a huge fan of Moleskine notebooks (that I also use in the field) and love writing with hi-tec C pens. Currently in love with my [Pen-type A](http://shop.cwandt.com/products/pen-type-a). Since I haven't done any real field work in almost 4 years other great field tools escape me.

#What software do you use?
I use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for nearly everything. This includes writing [R](http://www.r-project.org/) code/packages, [manuscripts](https://github.com/karthikram/smb_git), and [blog posts](http://inundata.org/). It's like the [swiss-army knife](http://timotheepoisot.fr/2013/01/22/selection-sublime-plugins/) of editors. I also use [iA writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) for distraction free writing. [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) gives me a live preview of my documents and I use [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to turn these into PDFs.  

I also spend a majority of my day with git/[GitHub](https://github.com/) since most of my collaborators and work projects are hosted there.  I use a [R](http://www.r-project.org/) a lot. My favorite R packages are [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [devtools](http://www.rstudio.com/projects/devtools/), [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and [mclapply](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html). [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) keeps me connected to all these tools and services.

I hear about recent papers, academic tools, and other news mostly via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_inundata) using [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) but also from rss feeds through Google Reader + [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/). I keep tabs on some of you via [Google Scholar alerts](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en). Long articles go to [Readability](http://www.readability.com/) through a [recipe](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/2595379) at [IFTT](http://ifttt.com/) (anything I favorite on Twitter is automatically sent to readability) and a digest ends up on my Kindle every morning at 4 am in time for me to read over coffee. All useful links are automatically bookmarked and privately cached on my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) account. 
  

#What would your dream set up be?

I'd love to switch to a Macbook Air with an Apple cinema display and ditch the pro. Given how cheap Amazon AWS instances are these days, I could always spin up EC2 for larger simulations and just use my lighter laptop for writing and reading. 

Also a new field site/system once I'm somewhere more permanent.
